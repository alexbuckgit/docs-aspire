When you create new Azure resources, it's important to follow the naming requirements. For Azure Container Apps, the name must be 2-32 characters long and consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. The name must start with a letter and end with an alphanumeric character.

For more information, see [Naming rules and restrictions for Azure resources](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules#microsoftapp).
